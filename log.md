# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: January 03, 2017
##### 

Challenge accepted for #100DaysOfCode! 
To start the year right, I decided to do the #100DaysOfCode challenge.

**For today's work:** Created a list of topics that I will be tackling for the next couple of days.
So first the topic, I will be diving in to the test driven development in rails.

### Day 1: January 04, 2017 (My Birthday!)
#####
Started learning the basics of test driven development in rails with rspec and capybara gems. 

**Today's progress:**
Followed this 1st [tutorial](https://semaphoreci.com/community/tutorials/getting-started-with-rspec),2nd [tutorial](https://www.relishapp.com/rspec/rspec-rails/v/3-5/docs/gettingstarted)
and wrote smallest possible test case for the application. I am new to testing in rails and no idea how it works, upon reading the tutorials, it gave me some insights about concepts of behavior-driven development, testing tools like rspec and capybara. Still figuring out how it works though. I am more excited to learn complex testing in the future.

### Day 2: January 05, 2017
#####
I wrote a couple of simple test scripts for rails project today. I also updated my Android SDK to the latest version and created a virtual device running Android Nougat. Today, I am also preparing my portfolio page.

### Day 3: January 06. 2017
#####
**Today's work:**
I scaffolded a new site for a rails project using [happy_seed](https://github.com/HappyFunCorp/happy_seed) gem and played around with this useful generator which is very similar to yeoman but this time it's for rails. I found this very useful for building out new site quickly, it helped me a lot to generate a lot of bootstrap code with ease from authentication (including social auth) to building and configuring administration of the site. Also today, I revisited Freecodecamp. It's been a while since the last time I dwell on the boot camp, so today I gave it a try again. Continuing learning javascript and it is always feels good to refresh your memory and relearn the basics.

### Day 4. January 07, 2017
#####
**Today's progress: **
Was not able to write code a lot because of sore body after workout. Was able to change minor design details on my portfolio page and fixed some typing errors. 
**Link to the project: **
[My Portfolio](http://leighayanid.bitbucket.org). The portfolio is not responsive yet and I need to do a lot of work for the next days. The design is also simple.
