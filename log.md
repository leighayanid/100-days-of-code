# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: January 03, 2017

Challenge accepted for #100DaysOfCode! 
To start the year right, I decided to do the #100DaysOfCode challenge.

**For today's work:** Created a list of topics that I will be tackling for the next couple of days.
So first the topic, I will be diving in to the test driven development in rails.

### Day 1: January 04, 2017 (My Birthday!)
#####
Started learning the basics of test driven development in rails with rspec and capybara gems. 

** Today's progress **
Followed this 1st [tutorial](https://semaphoreci.com/community/tutorials/getting-started-with-rspec),2nd [tutorial](https://www.relishapp.com/rspec/rspec-rails/v/3-5/docs/gettingstarted)
and wrote smallest possible test case for the application. I am new to testing in rails and no idea how it works, upon reading the tutorials, it gave me some insights about concepts of behavior-driven development, testing tools like rspec and capybara. Still figuring out how it works though. I am more excited to learn complex testing in the future.
