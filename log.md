<h2> 100 Days Of Code - Log </h2>

### Day 0: January 03, 2017 (Tuesday)
##### 

Challenge accepted for #100DaysOfCode! 
To start the year right, I decided to do the #100DaysOfCode challenge.

**For today's work:** Created a list of topics that I will be tackling for the next couple of days.
So first the topic, I will be diving in to the test driven development in rails.

### Day 1: January 04, 2017 (Wednesday. My Birthday!)
#####
Started learning the basics of test driven development in rails with rspec and capybara gems. 

**Today's progress:**
Followed this 1st [tutorial](https://semaphoreci.com/community/tutorials/getting-started-with-rspec),2nd [tutorial](https://www.relishapp.com/rspec/rspec-rails/v/3-5/docs/gettingstarted)
and wrote smallest possible test case for the application. I am new to testing in rails and no idea how it works, upon reading the tutorials, it gave me some insights about concepts of behavior-driven development, testing tools like rspec and capybara. Still figuring out how it works though. I am more excited to learn complex testing in the future.

### Day 2: January 05, 2017 (Thursday)
#####
I wrote a couple of simple test scripts for rails project today. I also updated my Android SDK to the latest version and created a virtual device running Android Nougat. Today, I am also preparing my portfolio page.

### Day 3: January 06. 2017 (Friday)
#####
**Today's work:**
I scaffolded a new site for a rails project using [happy_seed](https://github.com/HappyFunCorp/happy_seed) gem and played around with this useful generator which is very similar to yeoman but this time it's for rails. I found this very useful for building out new site quickly, it helped me a lot to generate a lot of bootstrap code with ease from authentication (including social auth) to building and configuring administration of the site. Also today, I revisited Freecodecamp. It's been a while since the last time I dwell on the boot camp, so today I gave it a try again. Continuing learning javascript and it is always feels good to refresh your memory and relearn the basics.

### Day 4. January 07, 2017 (Saturday)
#####
**Today's progress:**
Was not able to write code a lot because of sore body after workout. Was able to change minor design details on my portfolio page and fixed some typing errors.
#####
**Link to the project:**
[My Portfolio](http://leighayanid.bitbucket.org). The portfolio is not responsive yet and I need to do a lot of work for the next days. The design is also simple. 

### Day 5. January 09, 2017 (Monday)
#####
**Today's progress:**
Continued learning sass framework. Learn a bit of mixins and resets. 

### Day 6. January 10, 2017 (Tuesday)
#####
**Today's progress:**
For today's work, I added facebook and github authentication for a rails project. Set up new applications on Facebook developer console and Github developer page. (Yeah! I'm back on Facebook. duh. )

### Day 7. January 11, 2017 (Wednesday)
#####
**Today's progress:**
Continued working on my filecabinet rails project. I worked on styling the administration of the site and also added font awesome for adding icons to the design of the system. Also today I designed a template for my future projects in Photoshop, I did some layout with 12 grid px, planned what fonts to be used and structured color palette for branding.

### Day 8. January 12, 2017 (Thursday)
#####
**Today's work:**
Still working on my rails project. I hard a time to fix this bug in my design with bootstrap-sass. Been working on fixing the height and background color of the navigation. Changing variables of the navbar height and navbar backgorund only takes effect when the user is signed in but won't work on landing page. Weird bug isn't it? Hopefully I fix this issue the next day. SMH.    

### Day 9 January 13, 2017 (Friday)
#####
**Today's work:**
Still working on the front end side of the rails project. Designed the landing page and was able to fix that weird bug inside navbar which I found out that the problem was on generator that bootstraped that project from scratch.

### Day 10. January 14, 2017 (Saturday)
#####
**Today's work:**
Started to plan out my design for my project list. I also tweaked some design on my portfolio site which I am planning to move here on Github instead on Bitbucket due to design issue on http connection from Bitbucket's pages. Also this day, I started learning Travis CI which is a continous integration service used to build and test software projects that are hosted on Github. I love the free plan of the service, very thorough and easy to use. Very beginner friendly.

### Day 12 January 17, 2017 (Tuesday)
#####
**Today's work:**
I decided to refactor some structures on my project. I changed the project from storing simple text documents to specific files - snippets. Also today, I scaffolded new jekyll site for documenting my progress in #100DaysOfCode challenge. 

### Day 13 January 18, 2017 (Wednesday)
#####
**Today's work:**
I did a major refactoring on my file-snippets project. I renamed a lot of code from controllers to model and even on some db migration files and struggled a bit in changing the code since that was my first time to perform code refactoring without the help of an IDE. But after an hour of debugging, I was able to run the project successfully.

### Day 14 January 19, 2017 (Thursday)
#####
**Today's work:**
I edited one of my rails project - [Markee](https://github.com/leighayanid/markee). I created a welcome controller with index action to add welcome page to the system and avoid redirecting the user to login page. Also today, I created a new repository for my portfolio site here on Github, with the use of github page. Pushed the code and fix some issues. I found out that using content delivery network on github pages doesn't work, I am not sure why, but it didn't load the project well and stuck on loading page so what I did was I remove all the links from cdn provider in index.html and I downloaded all the css and javascript files from vendor's sites, add them to assets folder and link them to the project again. This time, the project works and I am happy that my portfolio is now working as expected. It is not finish though, I need to add a lot of improvements to it, maybe for the next couple of days. And by the way, I use some code from codepen, so credits to the owners.
